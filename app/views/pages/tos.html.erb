You may not assign this Agreement or the rights and duties hereunder, in whole or in part, to any third party without the prior written consent of heatUp.</p>
			<p><b>Severability</b></p>
			<p>Should one or more provisions of these Terms of Use be found to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision(s) shall be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and/or enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use, which will remain in full force and effect.</p>
			<p><b>Entire Agreement</b></p>
			<p>These Terms of Use, together with the<u> </u><u>Community Guidelines</u>,<u> </u><u>Privacy Policy</u> and<u> </u><u>Cookies Policy</u>, constitute the entire agreement between you and heatUp with respect to your use of the Platform (other than any use of heatUp’s APIs which may also be subject to separate API Terms of Use), and supersede any prior agreement between you and heatUp. Any modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing.</p>
			<p><b>Third Party Rights</b></p>
			<p>These Terms of Use are not intended to give rights to anyone except you and heatUp. This does not affect our right to transfer our rights or obligations to a third party as described in the<u> </u><u>Assignment to Third Parties</u> section.</p>
			<p><b>Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</b></p>
			<p>Except where otherwise required by the mandatory law of the United States and visions of this Applicable Law and Jurisdiction section do not apply to any claim in which heatUp seeks equitable relief of any kind. You acknowledge that, in the event of a breach of this Agreement by heatUp or any third party, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against heatUp, including with respect to Your Content, and your only remedy shall be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms of Use.</p>

The Cookies Policy also includes information about how you can block or disable third party cookies (which we only use for the purposes of analyzing the use of our Platform and optimizing the content on our Platform).</b></p>
			<p><b>We have done our best to provide you with as much information as possible about our use of cookies and similar technology. If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling these cookies or opting out of other technologies as described in our</b><b> </b><b><u>Cookies Policy</u></b><b>, you will indicate your consent to our use of these technologies and to our use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy) of any personal data that we collect using these technologies.</b></p>
			<p><b>Choice and control</b></p>
			<p><b>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of information you provide to us, and the control you have over that information.</b></p>
			<p><b>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any personal data in order to visit the Website, although certain information will be collected automatically by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to register a heatUp® account, you can control your information in the following ways.</b></p>
			<p><b>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to control the information you share with other networks and applications. As well as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also control access to other services and applications to which you have connected your heatUp® account.</b></p>
			<p><b>If you sign up for heatUp® using your Facebook account, your heatUp® account and your Facebook account respectively will be connected automatically. Information regarding the public sounds that you post, listen or favorite on heatUp®, will be shared with the connected Facebook account.

If you do not want this information shared with Facebook, please change your Settings.</b></p>
			<p><b>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party sites or applications, and we cannot control the activities of those sites or applications. You are advised to read the privacy policies of those sites or applications before sharing your information with, or connecting your heatUp® account to, any of these third party sites or applications.</b></p>
			<p><b>Sharing with other users</b></p>
			<p><b>If any of your sounds contain any personal data or any other information which you would not like to share, you can control who has access to these sounds using the settings in the sound page .</b></p>

			<p><b>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our</b><b> </b><b><u>Cookies Policy</u></b><b>. Further information is available at</b><b> </b><b><u><a href="http://aboutcookies.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://aboutcookies.org</a></u></b><b>.</b></p>

			<p><b>Deleting your account</b></p>

			<p><b>Even if you delete your heatUp® account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages.

			<p><b>Please note that deleting any heatUp® Apps, or any third party apps to which your heatUp® account is connected, will not delete your heatUp® account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Account tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your heatUp® account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third party app.</b></p>
			<p><b>Access to your data</b></p>
			<p><b>As described above, most of the personal data and other information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings page of your heatUp® account.

			<p>Google Analytics and Google Website Optimizer are services provided by Google, Inc. (“<b>Google</b>”).

			<p><b>Community Guidelines </b></p>
			<p>These Community Guidelines are designed to ensure that everyone understands what the heatUp® community is all about. Don't forget that your use of heatUp® is also subject to our Terms of Use.</p>
			<p><b>Do:</b></p>
			<ul><li><b>Respect others</b></li></ul>
			<p>heatUp® users are a diverse group with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great, but it means that everybody needs to be tolerant and respect people whose ideas are different to their own. Of course, if you feel that someone is expressing views or opinions that are offensive, defamatory, abusive, or otherwise contrary to our Terms of Use, you can let us know by sending us an email.</p>
			<ul><li><b>Create, upload and share</b></li></ul>
			<p>heatUp® enables you to express yourself through your sounds, and lets you share those sounds across the web. So, be creative, be expressive and let the world know how awesome you are. But remember – only share sounds that you have created yourself and have permission to share. </p>
			<p><b>Don't</b></p>
			<ul><li><b>Upload things that aren't yours to upload</b></li></ul>
			<p>Uploading and sharing means you must always be 100% certain that you are the creator of what you're uploading, or have permission from all relevant rights holders. Anyone who repeatedly uploads other people’s content risks having their account suspended or terminated. </p>
			<ul><li><b>Use someone else’s name</b></li></ul>
			<p>heatUp® usernames are allocated on a first come, first served basis. Please don’t register accounts in the name of another person, or using someone else’s trademark, even if this is meant as a tribute. If you feel that someone is impersonating you on heatUp®, or is infringing your trademark, you can tell us about it by sending us an email.</p>
			<ul><li><b>Spam</b></li></ul>
			<p>There’s a fine line between promoting your sounds and spamming. The more you can make your messages and actions personal and relevant, the less likely you are to be reported for spam. Faking your own popularity, or using sounds or comments to promote other products or services can be considered as spam and isn’t welcome on heatUp®.</p>
			<p><b>If you break these rules</b></p>
			<p>We take these rules seriously, and expect you to as well. If you break these rules we will take action. If we receive notification from a rights holder that any sounds, text or images in your account infringe their copyright, or if we believe that your behavior is inappropriate, we will send you a warning. If we have to send you more than two of these warnings, we <b>will suspend your account</b>. In the most extreme cases, we may suspend your account without warning.</p>
			<p><b>Tell us about it</b></p>
			<p>If you feel that someone is infringing your copyright, you can tell us about it by emailing us.</p>
			<p>If you want to report any other breaches of these Guidelines or our Terms of Use – including offensive or defamatory comments, trade mark infringement, impersonation, stalking, harassment, breach of privacy or spamming - you can report this to us by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:heatupmusic@gmail.com" target="_blank">heatupmusic@gmail.com</a>.</p>
			<p>Remember, we want heatUp® to be a community where everyone feels comfortable and respected - it’s up to all of us to make sure this happens.</p>
			<p><b>To Sum It Up</b></p>
			<p><b>Basically, be- nice, respect the law and think before you post. In most cases, we'll send you a warning before we take other measures and we'll always try to act reasonably. We think this is fair but if you don't agree, maybe heatUp® is not the place for you.</b></p>
			<p>These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want. We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather to make clear that this should be a place of respect between people and a place for responsible content posting. We hope you agree and understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.</p>
			<p>We may change these Community Guidelines from time to time, so please be sure to check back here every so often for any updates.</p>

			<p>By accepting these terms you also agree that if you are not under the age of 13, and if you are under the age of 18 you have the permission of a parent or legal guardian to use this website. </p>
